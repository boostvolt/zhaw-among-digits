## GitHub Workflow

### Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) describes the rules and guidelines for contributing to our
project.

### Branching Model

We used the feature branching workflow for several reasons:

- Firstly, it promotes better organization and management of code changes, especially those
  involving multiple team members working on different features or tasks simultaneously. By creating
  separate branches for each feature or task, developers can work on their code changes
  independently without interfering with the work of others. This reduces the likelihood of
  conflicts arising between different changes, which can be time-consuming to resolve.

- Secondly, the feature branching workflow also enables better tracking of code changes and easier
  identification of issues or bugs. Since each feature branch contains changes related to a specific
  feature or task, it is easier to pinpoint issues and resolve them quickly.

- Finally, the feature branching workflow also facilitates better quality control and helps ensure
  that the project's overall codebase remains stable and functional. Changes are tested and reviewed
  before they are merged back into the main branch, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or errors
  into the production code. This ensures that the final product is of high quality and meets the
  requirements of the stakeholders.
